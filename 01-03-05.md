Those who are accustomed to judge by sentiment never understand things
by reasoning, because they want to penetrate things at one glance and
are hardly accustomed to seek-out principles.  And the others, in
contrast, who are accustomed to reasoning by principles, never
understand things by feeling, they search three for principles, and
cannot see at a glance.

*Geometry, cunning.*--True eloquence mocks eloquence, true morals mock
morals; it is said that judging morals mock thinking morals--who are
without rules.

Because, judgment is that which relies on feeling, as the sciences rely
on the mind.  Cunning is part of judgment, geometry is that of
the mind.

Those who judge a work without a rule are, in regard to others, as
those who do not have a watch, in regard to others.  He says: "it's
been two hours," the other says "it is not three quarters before the
hour."  I look at my watch and I say this to one: "You harry yourself"
and to the other: "The time will scarcely last for you, because it is
an hour and a half."  And I make fun of those who tell me that the
time doesn't last for me, and who judge by fantasy; they never know
that I judge by my watch.

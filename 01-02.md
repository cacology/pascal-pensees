[There are] various sorts of right sense; those in the order of the
matter, and not in other orders, where they are incoherent

The one draws consequences well from a few principles, and there is
correctness to their sense.

The other draws the consequences well about things where there are
many principles.

For example, the effects of water are well known, in which there are
few principles; but, the consequences of these principles are so
subtle, that only an extremely upright mind can understand them.

And the former minds would not, perhaps, be great geometers, because
geometry contains a great number of principles, and the nature of the
mind can be such that it can investigate well a few principles to the
bottom, and that it cannot penetrate the least things of the world
where there are many principles.

There are two sorts of mind: the one, of deep and lively understanding
of some principles, which is the exacting mind; the other, which
understand a large number of principles without confusing them, which
is the geometric mind.  The one is a strong and correct mind, the
other a broad mind.  Now, the one can well be without the other, the
mind being strong and narrow, and also being wide and weak.

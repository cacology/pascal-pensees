As the mind wastes itself, so sense spoils itself.

The mind and sense train themselves through conversations.  The mind
and sense spoil themselves through conversations.  In this way, the
good and bad train it or spoil it.  Thus, it is important to choose to
know all of the good, for it trains and never spoils; and you can't
make this choice, if the mind and sense has not already been trained
in the slightest and--is instead--spoiled.  Therefore, it makes
a self-reinforcing cycle, where they are blessed who go beyond
bad conversations.

There are many people who understand the sermon in the same way they

When one wants to correct easily, and to show to another what was
wrong, he must see the reasoning by which the other considers the
thing, for that reasoning is usually right, and to admits to him
a truth, merely show him the way which it is false.  He will be
content with this, for he sees that he wasn't wrong, and that he only
failed to see all the sides; Now, no one can be angry about not
noticing, but one does not want to be wrong; and, perhaps, it comes
from this, that--naturally--man cannot see all, and because of this,
naturally he couldn't be wrong in the aspects that he considers; as
the apprehension of the senses are always true.  Blah blah blah--I'm
showing Sarah.

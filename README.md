# A Translation of Pascal's Pensées

To practice translating French, I've set before myself the task of
translating Blaise Pascal's *Pensées* into English.  I'm working from
*Pensées* / text établi par Léon Brunschvicg / chronologie,
introduction, notes, archives de l'œuvre, index par Dominique
Descotes.  GF Flammarion, 1976.  (2-09-070266-1) The text in that book
was established by Léon Brunschvicg in Édition Hachette, 1897.
I don't know if this is the best edition or not, but it's one that
I found at a used bookshop inexpensively, so there.  Each section will
be translated as a separate file in this directory.

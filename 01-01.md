[**p. 49**] *The difference between the geometric mind and the cunning
mind:* In the first, principles are tangible, but removed from
everyday use; so that it is difficult to turn the mind to them without
practice: but if ever it turns there, the principles will seem plain;
and he would necessarily have a completely false mind to reason poorly
from principles so grand that it is nearly impossible to escape
from them.

But in the cunning mind, principles are in everyday use and known by
the whole world.  The mind doesn't have to be turn, nor forced; it is
only a question of having a proper viewpoint, but it must be good: for
principles are so slight and in such a great number, that it is nearly
impossible that one does not escape from him.  Now, the omission of
one principle leads to a mistake; thus, he must have very clear sight
to see all principles, and then an exact mind to not reason falsely
based on known principles.

All the geometers, thus, would be cunning if they had good sight, for
they do not reason falsely on principles they know, and the cunning
minds would be geometers, if they could apply their vision to
unaccustomed geometric principles.

For this reason, thus, certain subtle minds are not geometers: it is
that they are not able to totally apply themselves to geometric
principles; but for this reason geometers are not cunning: it is that
they don't see what is in front of them, and that they are accustomed
to clear principles and the crudeness of geometry, and only to reason
after having well reviewed and managed their principles, they are lost
in cunning things, where principles do not allow themselves to be
managed thus.  They [principles] are hardly seen, they are felt sooner
than they are [**50**] seen;
